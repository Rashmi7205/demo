##a)What is variable?

    \n,\t,\,\\(Backslach),\r(carrige value),\b(backspace),\ooo(octal),\xhh (hex value)
##g)What is flow chart
    It is a graphical representation of a progam to solve any problem
    It uses different types of symbols to represent the entities of the program
    It includes different steps of execution of the program
##h)What are 3 types of numbers in python?
    complex,
    int(),
    float()

## i)How can we round a number?
    Using round() we can find the round the value.
## j)Define the term algorithm?
    Algorithm is the approach to solve any problem.
    It is the process of solveing a problem.

## k)Difference between variable and constant?
     variable is identifier which value can be changed multiple times.
     but we cannot change the value of any constant more than once.
